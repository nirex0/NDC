WELCOME
=======

Welcome to NDC(Nirex Designer Core), A Collection of the two discontinued projects IDL(Innovative Dynamic Lib) and NControl.

INTRODUCTION
============

NDC Aims to provide a small set of Core
Functionalities and a set of custom made 
C# Controls, allowing you to create good
looking applications with awesome animations.



Sadly, there is no Documentation Available 
in the "Wiki" section as of yet, the only 
way to put this API to use is to open the 
"NDC Based Project" provided with this package 
in Visual studio and start working from there.
